## `.3` fused M-RoPE candidate (SM120)

The `.2` regression was reproduced with the CPU sidecar idle: enabling the
multimodal/embedding-capable GPU path disabled the fused QK-norm + RoPE + gate
decoder path. The incremental `.3` patch extends that existing Triton kernel
for Qwen3.5's T/H/W M-RoPE (contiguous and interleaved sections), keeping the
base image and all native CUDA artifacts unchanged. The minimal Docker layer
contains the two production Python files and is recorded as 12,600 bytes;
Triton JIT compiles the new variants on first use into the persisted cache.

The reviewed CUDA correctness matrix passed **9/9** cases. The exact vision
fixture passed **2/2** images (both color/shape/label checks). These are SM120
(RTX 5090) results; SM121 (DGX Spark/GB10) remains unvalidated.

### Matched decode matrix

Narrative/code tok/s, measured with the same DFlash2 K7 profile and workload
shape. The candidate keeps the multimodal server configuration active; the
control uses `.2`'s `--language-model-only` path.

| Concurrency | `.3` candidate narrative / code | `.2` language-only narrative / code |
|---:|---:|---:|
| c1 | 107.72 / 206.63 | 106.26 / 192.76 |
| c2 | 215.87 / 352.09 | 213.30 / 370.32 |
| c3 | 307.44 / 453.91 | 316.07 / 455.56 |
| c4 | 403.77 / 616.33 | 405.54 / 592.75 |

The prior multimodal control was 61.6 narrative / 105.7 code tok/s, versus
116.2 / 202.4 in language-only mode. The candidate removes that roughly
50-percent decode cliff without requiring a native rebuild.

### Upstream duplicate-work check

The implementation area is already covered by open upstream efforts
[vLLM #49744](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/49744) and
[vLLM #43056](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/43056). The release
keeps this as a narrow pinned-vLLM backport and does not open a duplicate PR.

## What makes this build unique

No public container, repo, or blog ships a working **NVFP4 weights + NVFP4
draft + NVFP4 KV + DFlash2 + concurrency** stack on a 5090. The universal
pattern is NVFP4 weights + FP8 KV; the DFlash2 draft is usually BF16 or
W8A16. This release is the all-NVFP4 4/4 artifact, with the drafter
itself NVFP4 (W4A16, group-16, compressed-tensors `nvfp4-pack-quantized`).

## Vision disposition

The historical CPU-sidecar correctness gates passed, but that design kept the
GPU server embedding-capable. The CPU process was idle during text-only tests;
the regression was caused by the GPU model path. In this pinned vLLM source,
Qwen3.5's `use_fused_qk_norm_rope_gate` is enabled only when
`multimodal_config.language_model_only` is true. Limiting image/video counts to
zero prunes the vision tower but does not enable the fused decoder path.

Release `.2` disabled vision and multimodal embeddings to protect decode
throughput. Release `.3` restores the optional profile after the fused M-RoPE
kernel extension: the GPU server stays on the multimodal-capable path, while
the CPU sidecar remains bounded at 4 CPUs, 6 GB, and 256 processes. Start it
with `./start.sh --vision` and run `./verify.sh --vision` for the exact fixture.

## Rollback

Stop the DFlash2 Compose project (`./stop.sh`) and start the unchanged
pinned MTP project (`vllm-sm120-nvfp4-mtp` on :18079). Both repos, images,
model caches, and configs remain installed; only one 27B GPU server runs
at a time on a 32 GiB card.
